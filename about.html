                <h3>About Me.</h3>
            </header>
            <p>I recently graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor’s of Global studies, 
                specialising in international relations. I am currently undertaking the Code, 
                Cloud & Cyber Security Course at Coder Academy and will graduate with a Diploma 
                of Information Technology in 2022.</p>
            <p>When I am not studying or working, I am usually spending time with my dog and cat, 
                playing video games (RPGs are my favourite) or baking/cooking. Prior to COVID-19, 
                I also spent a lot of time travelling and have lived abroad in both the Netherlands 
                and Malaysia.</p>
