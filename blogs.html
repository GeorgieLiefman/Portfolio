                            <p>HTML is the most commonly used markup language – a system designed to process, define, and present text by embedding tag and text annotations within styled files to make text manipulation easy for the computer. In 2014, an update for this language titled HTML5 was released. But what is HTML5? HTML vs HTML5, what’s the difference? In this article, we will answer that question.</p>
                            <h4>HTML VS HTML5 – What Are the Main Differences?</h4>
                            <p>HTML5 was released with the primary objective of improving the World Wide Web experience for developers and end-users. In this HTML vs HTML5 article, we’ll briefly list the main differences:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML5 supports SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), canvas, and other virtual vector graphics, whereas in HTML, using vector graphics was only possible by using it in conjunction with different technologies like Flash, VML (Vector Markup Language), or Silverlight.</li>
                                <li>Web SQL databases are used in HTML5 for storing data temporarily. Meanwhile, in the previous version of HTML, only browser cache could be utilized for this purpose.</li>
                                <li>With HTML5, JavaScript can run within a web browser, while the older HTML only allows JavaScript to run in the browser interface thread.</li>
                                <li>HTML5 is not based on SGML. This means that the language has improved parsing rules which provide enhanced compatibility.</li>
                                <li>You can use inline MathML and SVG in text with HTML5, whereas HTML restricts it.</li>
                                <li>Some elements are removed in HTML5, like isindex, noframes, acronym, applet, basefont, dir, font, frame, frameset, big, center, strike, and tt.</li>
                                <li>HTML5 supports new kinds of form controls, including dates and times, email, number, range, tel, url, search, etc.</li>
                                <li>There are multiple new features and new elements in HTML5. Some of the most important ones are summary, time, aside, audio, command, data, datalist, and so on. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>GitHub is considered an essential tool for software engineers, and its popularity is unrivaled. It currently accommodates more than 25 million users. That’s a considerable number of professionals turning to GitHub for workflow and collaboration improvements.</p>
                            <p>In short, GitHub is a cloud-based service that hosts a version control system (VCS) called Git. It allows developers to collaborate and make changes to shared projects while keeping detailed track of their progress.</p>
                            <h4>What Is Version Control?</h4>
                            <p>Version control is a system that helps to track and manage changes made to a file or a set of files. Mainly used by software engineers to track modifications made to source code, the version control system lets them analyze all changes and reverse them without repercussions if a mistake is made.</p>
                            <p>In other words, version control lets developers work on projects simultaneously. It allows them to make as many changes as they need without infringing on or delaying their colleagues’ work.</p>
                            <p>If said changes to source code ruin the project when they are deployed, GitHub makes it easy to reverse them with a few clicks, and the previous version of the project will be brought back.</p>
                            <p>To summarize, version control takes away the risks and the fear of making too many mistakes. Instead, it provides the freedom to collaborate and develop without too much worry.</p>
                            <h4>What Is Git?</h4>
                            <p>Git is an open-source project that was started in 2005 and grew to be one of the most popular VCS on the market – over 87% of developers use Git for their projects.</p>
                            <p>It’s a distributed version control system. Meaning, any developer on the team with granted access can manage the source code and its history of changes using Git command line tools.</p>
                            <p>Unlike the centralized version control systems, Git offers feature branches. This means every software engineer in the team can split off a feature branch that provides an isolated local repository for making changes to the code.</p>
                            <p>Feature branches don’t affect the master branch, which is where the original project code is located. Once the changes are made and the updated code is ready, the feature branch can be merged back with the master branch, which is how the changes to the project will become effective.</p>
                            <h4>What Is GitHub and Why Is It So Popular?</h4>
                            <p>GitHub hosts over 100 million repositories, the majority of which are open-source projects. This statistic shows that GitHub is among the most popular Git GUI clients and is used by various professionals and large businesses, such as Hostinger</p>
                            <p>This is because GitHub is a cloud-based project management and organization platform that incorporates Git’s version control features. Meaning, all GitHub users can track and manage changes being made to the source code in real-time while having access to all of the other Git functions available to them at the same place.</p>
                            <p>What’s more, GitHub’s user interface is more user-friendly than Git, making it accessible to people who possess little-to-no technical knowledge. This means that more team members can be included in the progress and management of a project, making the development process smoother.</p>

                                <p id="author_info">Mar 09, 2021 | Artūras B.</p>
                            </header>
                            <img src="Images/blog_images/CSS-logo.png" alt="CSS logo" id="css_logo">
                            <p>CSS is what’s called a Cascading Style Sheet language, and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site.</p>
                            <p>CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996, for a rather simple reason. HTML was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the site.</p>
                            <p>Tags like <font> were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of troubles for developers. Since websites had different fonts, colored backgrounds, and styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.</p>
                            <p>The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together. Since HTML is a markup language (the very foundation of a site) and CSS emphasizes style (all of the aesthetics of a website), they go hand in hand together.</p>
                            <p>CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn’t want to look at a site that features only HTML as it would look completely bare-boned.</p>
                            <h4>CSS Advantages</h4>
                            <p>The difference between a website which implements CSS and one that doesn’t is massive and surely noticeable.</p>
                            <p>You might have seen a website that fails to load completely and has a white background with most of the text being blue and black. This means that the CSS part of the site didn’t load correctly or it doesn’t exist altogether.</p>
                            <p>That’s how a site with only HTML looks like, and I think you’d agree that that’s not very appealing.</p>
                            <p>Before using CSS, all of the stylizing had to be included into the HTML markup. This means you had to separately describe all the background, font colors, alignments, etc.</p>
                            <p>CSS lets you stylize everything on a different file, thus creating the style there and later on integrating the CSS file on top of the HTML markup. This makes the actual HTML markup much cleaner and easier to maintain.</p>
                            <p>In short, with CSS you don’t need to repeatedly describe how individual elements look. This saves time, shortens the code and makes it not as prone to errors.</p>
                            <p>CSS lets you have multiple styles on one HTML page, therefore making the customization possibilities almost endless. Nowadays, this is becoming more a necessity than a commodity.</p>

                            <p>When looking to set up your website, the first thing you need to take care of is web hosting. If you’re not sure where to start, check out this report by Hosting Data on the best web hosting services in the UK. However, even with most of the basics done and ready, taking your time to work on the backend will truly take your website to a new level.</p>
                            <p>An example of such work is creating a sitemap – an important part of your website’s backbone and essential for any SEO strategy you might have.</p>
                            <h4>What Is a Sitemap?</h4>
                            <p>What is a sitemap? As the name suggests, it’s a map of every page on your site. Of course, it’s not the typical map that you’d find under the header bar.</p>
                            <p>Instead, a sitemap is made in XML (Extensible Markup Language) and is primarily used as a way for AI to index your site easier. Search engines like Google use XML sitemaps to store your site’s pages more efficiently, producing better results when people search for related terms.</p>
                            <h4>Why Is Having a Sitemap Important?</h4>
                            <p>The primary importance of having a sitemap is to help support your SEO strategy.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned above, search engines use crawlers to go through websites and index them together, taking a closer look at the content on their pages. By providing these crawlers with a map of your site, your content can be indexed more quickly. That way, it’s easier for these crawlers to show results when somebody searches for a keyword.</p>
                            <p>Sitemaps contain very pertinent information about your website, such as update frequency, where the page is in relation to other pages and your landing page, and how important that page is. The sitemap will even let search engines know that you don’t have any duplicate content, which is a big problem when it comes to SEO.</p>

                            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.</p>
                            <p>HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
                            <p>When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a starting <p> and closing </p> tag.</p>
                            <p>Overall, HTML is a markup language that is really straightforward and easy to learn even for complete beginners in website building. </p>
                            <h4>How Does HTML Work?</h4>
                            <p>HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.</p>
                            <p>Usually, the average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance: home pages, about pages, contact pages would all have separate HTML documents.</p>
                            <p>Each HTML page consists of a set of tags (also called elements), which you can refer to as the building blocks of web pages. They create a hierarchy that structures the content into sections, paragraphs, headings, and other content blocks.</p>
                            <p>Most HTML elements have an opening and a closing that use the <tag></tag> syntax.</p>
